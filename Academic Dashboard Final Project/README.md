Write README.md in your repository to document your code. It should document your project work, consisting of the following:

**Title:** 

ProfConnect: Empowering collaboration through academic insights.


**Purpose:** What is the application scenario? Who are the target users? What are the objectives? (R4)(R5)

Objectives
The main goal of ProfConnect is to assist users in identifying and connecting with professors whose research and interests aligns with user's interests. It aims to streamline the process of finding potential collaborators, mentors, research guides or information by providing an intuitive dashboard to explore academic data. 
- Personalized Professor Discovery: Allow users to search for professors based on university affiliation, research keywords, and other metrics.
- Enhanced Decision-Making: Provide detailed insights about professors, including their published papers, citation amount, position, key research areas, keyword interest score and more.
- Connection and Organization: Enable users to shortlist (favorite) professors, save and update professors as interests with interest levels and add descriptions for future reference.

Target Users
- Graduate Students: Looking for advisors or collaborators in their field of study.
- Undergraduates: Exploring research opportunities or identifying mentors for capstone projects.
- Researchers: Identifying potential collaborators for interdisciplinary research.
- Academics: Understanding the academic landscape of a particular field.
- Knowledge Seekers: Looking to learn more about a subject area.

Scenarios and Tasks
  Scenario 1: Graduate Student Planning Research Collaboration
  A graduate student is interested in data science research. They use the dashboard to:
  - Search for professors working at specific universities (e.g., CMU, UIUC).
  - Filter by research keywords (e.g., "machine learning")
  - Look at professors with the top scores and see their citation count and number of publications to find top researchers.
  - Look at their publications and filter by citation count and year.
  - Review detailed profiles, delete profiles they no longer are interested and shortlist professors for outreach.

  Scenario 2: Undergraduate Seeking Research Opportunities
  An undergraduate wants to explore professors at their institution who have published papers in a specific field. They:
  - Search for professors at their university by keyword.
  - View their publication history to identify alignment with their interests.
  - Add them to the General interets list with an interest level and desciption, and updates description and interest as they find out more.
  - Shortlist the top professors.
  - Email selected professors for potential research opportunities.
  
  Scenario 3: Researcher Identifying Collaboration Opportunities
  A researcher aims to find potential collaborators in a new interdisciplinary project. They:
  - Search for professors across multiple universities.
  - Review their academic research and keyword interests, and publications.
  - Compile a list of suitable candidates for outreach.

**Implementation:** How did you implement it? What frameworks and libraries or any tools have you used to realize the dashboard and functionalities? 

  The implementation of the dashboard followed a structured, iterative approach. Initially, I conceptualized the idea for the dashboard and decided on the widgets to include. To realize the functionalities, I utilized several tools and frameworks, with Dash being the primary library for creating the interactive web application. Pandas was utilized for the dataframe for the bar and pie chart and plotly was used for the plotting. Additional utility modules, such as mysql_utils.py, mongodb_utils.py, and neo4j_utils.py, were developed to handle database interactions with MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j, respectively. These utility scripts were tested using examples to ensure that queries could be performed effectively against the respective databases.

  The implementation process began with coding the utility modules to establish and validate database connections. I used pymysql, MongoClient from pymongo and GraphDatabase from neo4j. Afterward, I focused on the app.py file, which serves as the main entry point for the application. I developed one widget at a time, starting with non-updating widgets to establish the core functionality. Within each widget, I first would lay out the front-end components using and then move onto the functionality. The dash compneonets I used were dcc, html, Input, Output, State and dash_table.

  Once the initial widgets were operational, I incorporated a style.css file to refine the user interface and ensure consistent styling, which also helped in debugging and visual validation. Subsequently, I worked on integrating more complex, updating widgets, ensuring they reflected real-time data and user interactions seamlessly. Throughout this process, I revisited and refined database querying techniques to optimize performance and reliability.

  Finally, I performed comprehensive testing and adjustments to finalize both the dashboard functionalities and the database interactions, ensuring the system operates as intended in an efficient and user-friendly manner.


**Database Techniques:** What database techniques have you implemented? How? (R13, R14, R15)

1. Indexing
  Objective: Improve query performance by reducing search space. 
  Implementation:
  - MySQL: Created indexes on publication attributes like year and num_citations in the publication table for faster filtering and sorting. Additionally, indexed relationships in the faculty_publication table to optimize joins between FACULTY and PUBLICATION. create_indexes()
  - Neo4j: Defined indexes on frequently accessed node properties, such as name (FACULTY) and id (PUBLICATION), using CREATE INDEX queries for efficient traversal. create_index()
  - MongoDB: Added single-field and compound indexes on the FACULTY collection fields like name and position to expedite search operations. create_index() and setup_indexes()
  Impact: These indexing strategies substantially reduced query response times, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets or complex joins.
2. Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)
  Objective: Ensure secure and efficient execution of queries.
  Implementation: Used prepared statements across MySQL and Neo4j databases to precompile query plans and protect against injection attacks.
  - MySQL: Parameterized queries to safely pass user input, especially for dynamic filters in the publication explorer. Used parameterized queries in methods like fetch_publications() to safely handle user inputs for dynamic filters. execute_query(base_query, params)
  - Neo4j: Incorporated query parameters to reuse execution plans and securely pass dynamic inputs, e.g., professor names or keywords. execute_cypher_query(cypher_query, parameters)
  Impact: Improved security by preventing injection attacks and optimized execution times for repetitive queries.
3. Views
  Objective: Simplify complex queries and provide a clear representation of aggregated data.
  Implementation:
  - MySQL: Created views like publication_details to encapsulate multi-table joins involving FACULTY and PUBLICATION. This view streamlined data retrieval for widgets like the publication explorer. create_view_publication_details()
  Impact: Simplified repeated query logic, reduced redundancy, and provided an intuitive structure for data analysis and reporting.
4. Transactions
  Objective: Ensure data consistency by treating multiple queries as a single unit of work.
  Implementation:
  - MySQL: Used transactions to manage batch operations like creating indexes, ensuring either complete success or full rollback in case of errors. execute_transaction(index_queries)
  Impact: Maintained data integrity during operations involving multiple interdependent queries.
